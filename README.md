This code remains public as a reference to compare my new code quality to. This was my first large programming project that was not created with a tutorial holding my hand. 
There are a lot of problems with it, functions that are doing more than one thing, very poor readability, and horrendously high time complexities. 
That being said, I learned so much from this project, and I am proud I was willing to attempt something so daunting with a final project grade on the line.
